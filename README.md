# PTSL1-CANbus-Shiftlight
CANbus shift light. An Arduino project that works with Neopixels and MCP2515 to make a shiftlight that works over CAN.

Thank you for your interest in the PT Motorsport Arduino shift light project! We’re very excited to be able to share this project with you. 

Projects like these are made possible by your support through purchases on the PT Motorsport AU website. Thank you for your support! We greatly appreciate you spreading the word about our products and services to your fellow motorsport enthusiasts.

This PT Motorsport AU Shift Light module is a CANbus controlled shift light. It uses messages from the vehicle's CANbus to determine the engine’s RPM and illuminate the neopixels in a shift light pattern as dictated by you, the programmer.
